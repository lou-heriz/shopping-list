# shopping-list
An application that allows you to manage a shopping list. 

This project is for a technical assessment.

### Estimation

I estimated the time to develop for each story as follows: 

| Story | Estimated time | Cumulative time
|-|-|-|
|SL-1|30 minutes| 30 minutes |
|SL-2|60 minutes| 1.5 hours|
|SL-3|30 minutes| 2 hours|
|SL-4|45 minutes| 2.75 hours|
|SL-5|90 minutes| 4.25 hours |
|SL-6|60 minutes| 5.25 hours |
|SL-7|30 minutes| 5.75 hours |
|SL-8|45 minutes| 6.5 hours |
|SL-9|90 minutes| 8 hours|
|SL-10|75 minutes| 9.25 hours|

As a result the goal is to complete stories 1-7 within the 6 hours. 

Before starting I have already set up a skeleton app with code coverage report via cypress. 

You can check the coverage report by running `npm run test:coverage`
